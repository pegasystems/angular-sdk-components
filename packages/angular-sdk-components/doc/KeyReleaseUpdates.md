This is the initial release of the Angular SDK Components packages: [**@pega/angular-sdk-components**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pega/angular-sdk-components) and [**@pega/angular-sdk-overrides**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pega/angular-sdk-overrides).This release contains all of the bridge and component code that was in the original packaging of the Angular SDK (which is now available in the Angular SDK's release/8.8.10 branch).

These packages support use with **Pega Infinity&trade; 23** and used in conjunction with the [**Pega Constellation Angular SDK**](https://community.pega.com/marketplace/components/angular-sdk).

* [**angular-sdk-components**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pega/angular-sdk-components) <br />
This package contains the run-time (compiled) code for the Pega-provided **bridge**
to the [**ConstellationJS Engine**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pega/constellationjs) and the **DX components**. The DX Components are a reference implementation that use the [Angular Material](https://v16.material.angular.io/) design system.

* [**angular-sdk-overrides**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@pega/angular-sdk-overrides) <br />
This package contains the source (uncompiled) code for the **DX Components**. This code is used as the starting point for any components that a Angular SDK user chooses to override.
Refer to the [Constellation SDKs Documentation](https://docs.pega.com/bundle/constellation-sdk/page/constellation-sdks/sdks/constellation-sdks.html) for more information about overriding components.
